# PhoneBook_Array_List

A simple command-line Phone Book application built in Java using `ArrayList`. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles by separating logic into two classes: `Main` (handles the user interface) and `PhoneBookArrayList` (handles contact management logic).

## Features
- View all saved contacts
- Uses Java `ArrayList` to store data dynamically

### `PhoneBookArrayList`
- Stores and manages contacts using an `ArrayList`
- Methods for adding, searching, deleting, and displaying contacts

### `Main`
- Contains the `main` method
- Takes user input and calls appropriate methods in `PhoneBookArrayList`
